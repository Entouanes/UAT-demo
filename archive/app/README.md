# UAT Interface Simulation

This project provides a user interface to simulate User Acceptance Testing (UAT). Launch the web-based UI by simply double-clicking the "index.html" file. The script mimics functionalities that are typically unavailable in standard browser environments, such as accessing device network configuration and performing system calls, to facilitate various testing scenarios.
